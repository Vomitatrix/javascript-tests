# As I have been learning JavaScript on and off the last few weeks but haven't been pushing it on GitHub, my activity seems to have stopped.
# I decided to make a new repository where I will be pushing my JS tests and experiments as I learn.
# Some of it may not make a lot of sense thought but it ought to keep my activity normal.
